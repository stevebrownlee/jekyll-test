# City Planner

You are in charge of the city planning for your town. When new companies come to town, they often want to make a statement, but the city has a height requirement on any new building. Your job is to count how many buildings currently are the highest.

Example:

```js
const buildings = [ 1250, 800, 600, 1250, 750 ]
```

The current maximum height buildings are 1250 meters high. There are 2 of them, so return 2 from the function.

## Function Description

The function should accept an array of numbers as input.

## Returns

The number of buildings that are tallest.

### Sample Input

```js
[ 1150, 3023, 2020, 3023, 3023 ]
```

### Sample Output
