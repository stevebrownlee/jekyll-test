# Making Pottery

In this exercise, you will be defining some functions that perform the individual tasks involved in making pottery. Pottery minions that will do all the little things needed to make beautiful pieces of dirt art.

Time to deconstruct the process of making pottery.

1. Buy a big lump of clay
2. Use a pottery wheel to turn the clay into a bowl
3. Put the bowl into a kiln for a bisque firing
4. Apply glaze to bowl
5. Put glazed bowl in kiln for final firing
6. ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° (_haha, yeah right_)

## Requirements for Your Minions

### Purchasing Clay

Define a function named `buyClay`. The function needs no parameters. It should return an object with no properties on it yet.

### Throw a Bowl

Define a function named `makePottery`. You need to pass it the empty object that `buyClay` produced, so it needs a single parameter to capture that value and use it.

The function should perform the task of adding a new property named `shape`, and its value should be "Bowl". The function should then return the object after the new property was added.

#### Reminder: When a function returns a value, you should store that value in a variable

### Bisque Firing

Define a function named `bisqueFire`. You need to give it the object that `makePottery` produced, so it needs a single parameter to capture that value and use it.

The function should perform the task of adding a new property named `readyForGlazing`, and its value should be `true`. The function should then return the object after the new property was added.

### Glaze the Bowl

Define a function named `glazePottery`. You need to give it the object that `bisqueFire` produced, so it needs a single parameter to capture that value and use it.

The function should check if the pottery has been bisque fired already and is ready for glazing. If it has not, you should log the following message to the console.

```
Make sure you bisque fire the pottery before you glaze it.
```

If the pottery has been bisque fired, the function should perform the task of adding a new property named `glazing`, and its value should be "Midnight Blue". The function should then return the object after the new property was added.

### Fire the Bowl

Define a function named `finalFiring`. You need to give it the object that `glazePottery` produced, so it needs a parameter to capture that value and use it. It also needs to capture the temperature of the kiln, so it needs two parameters.

The function should perform the task of adding a new property named `cracked`, and its value depend on the value of the `temperature` parameter. If that value is higher than 1200, then the value of the `cracked` property must be `true`. If the value is 1200, or less, the value should be `false`.

The function should then return the object after the new property was added.

To test the function, make sure you invoke it and pass two arguments. First test if a high temperate cracks the pottery.

```js
const firedPottery1400 = finalFiring(glazedPottery, 1400)
console.log(firedPottery1400)
```

Also test if the temperature is correct, check that the pottery is not cracked.

```js
const firedPottery1200 = finalFiring(glazedPottery, 1200)
console.log(firedPottery1200)
```

## Optional Challenge

#### Reminder: When a function returns a value, you should store that value in a variable

Start with purchasing some clay, and then pass the object to each function, in order, so that the final `console.log()` should have an object with all properties on it.

```js
{
  shape: 'Bowl',
  readyForGlazing: true,
  glazing: 'Midnight Blue',
  cracked: false
}
```


### Helpful hints

You can expand the hints below if you are stuck and don't know what to do. Make sure you try a few times and fail, and then talk with your teammates before looking at the hints.

}

<details>
    <summary>Hint: Cracked or not cracked</summary>

```js
const finalFiring = (potteryObject, temperature) => {
    if (temperature > 1200) {
        // Add cracked property with value of true
    }
    else {
        // Add cracked property with value of false
    }
}
