# Sorting Objects in an Array

Modify the `getRequests()` method in the data access module to return an array of service request objects that are sorted by their completion status.  Incomplete ones should be displayed first. As soon as a service request is completed, it should be marked with a different color and sorted to the bottom of the list.

Start with a web search [about how to do it](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=javascript+array+sort+by+boolean+property&ia=web) and see if you can figure it out by the advice given to other people.
