# Hire Buttons and Lollipop the Clowns

![](./images/buttons.jpeg)

Mike Loblonski had aspirations to be an actor on a soap opera. He went to a local college and got a degree in Drama, and then headed to the West Coast to break into the business. His hopes were high as he got into several dozen auditions in his first few months on the scene.

While on an audition, he met a woman named Leslie Ross who talked about how she made some money in between her part-time parts on shows and commercials. She is Lollipop the Clown. She gets booked for kids' birthday parties and performs simple magic tricks and other silly antics to entertain the kids.

She says it pays enough to make ends meet when she's not working as an actor.

As the months went by and Mike wasn't getting any paying gigs as an actor, he thought of Leslie and did some research on how to do what she does. Turns out, the cost was low enough that he could pay for the wardrobe, makeup and some supplies with the remaining savings that he had.


So he pulled the trigger and bought everything he needed. He decided on calling himself Buttons. Also, after discussions with Leslie, they decided to work together.

He put an ad in the local paper looking for a software developer that could make him a web site that people could use to book their services.

## Requirements

In your meeting with Mike, here's that information that he wants people to provide when they want to book him for a party.

* Parent name
* Child name
* How many children attending the party
* Address of the party
* Date of reservation
* Length of reservation in hours

When people request a reservation, he wants them all listed in chronological order - closest date first. He also wants the ability to delete requests.

Once the party is over, he wants the ability to say if he or Leslie filled the reservation.
