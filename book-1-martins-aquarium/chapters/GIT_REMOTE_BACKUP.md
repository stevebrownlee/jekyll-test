# Github Basics

Github is a _software as a service_ (SAAS) that allows you to back up your repository to the cloud and share it with other software developers. Note that it is not the same thing as git, which is an application you are running locally on your machine. Github and git are made to talk to each other, but they are separate entities.

## Pushing to Github

When you are ready to share your code with your teammates, or the general public, you can push your repository to Github. Think of Github as an external drive you plug into your laptop to use as backup. Instead of it backing up the entire hard drive, you will back things up, one project at a time, only when you want to.

The first thing you need to do is create a new repository on Github's platform that you will use to backup the code on your laptop.

### Create Github Repo

1. Log into your Github account.
1. Click the `+` sign in the top right corner.
1. Choose "New repository".
1. In the "Repository name" field, enter in `nss-aquarium`.
1. Scroll down and click the green "Create Repository" button.
1. Copy the repository's connection string.

1. Follow the second set of instructions.

Now that the code has successfully been backed up, go back to your browser, and refresh the page. You will see that your remote repository backup now has your aquarium HTML, JavaScript and CSS files in it.


## Practice: Backup Exercise

* Create a Github repository for the Congressional Representative exercise, and push up that code.
* Create a Github repository for the Coffee Houses exercise, and push up that code.

When you are done, you should have three new repositories in your Github account.

1. Aquarium
1. Coffee Houses
1. Congressional Representative

> **Tip:** If you have any issues getting your code onto Github, see a member of your instructional team immediately so that you have a backup of your code. Pushing your code to Github is not optional. It's a required part of this program.
