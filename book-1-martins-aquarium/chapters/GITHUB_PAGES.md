# Publishing with Github Pages

Github provides a simple mechanism to publish a static web site. By static web site, it must meet the following critieria.

1. Your site must not use XHR or `$ajax()` to load any of your site files.
1. Your site must be dependant upon a persistent database file, or system.
1. Your site must not rely upon any automation tools like Grunt, Gulp, Sass, or Webpack to operate.

The [Github documentation for publishing](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) is easy to follow, so we won't regurgutate the information here.

## Deploying to Github Pages with a custom domain
If you would like to use your own domain, rather than the default `github.io` domain, you can follow these directions.

Inspired by [this post](https://medium.com/employbl/launch-a-website-with-a-custom-url-using-github-pages-and-google-domains-3dd8d90cc33b).

Before getting started, we are assuming you have the following completed:
1. Static personal website (see above criteria)
1. Github repo created
1. Domain purchased (www.namecheap.com is a common one but any will do. These directions will show with a domain purchased on namecheap)

## CNAME
Create a CNAME file (at the same level as my index.html)
![File Structure](./images/file-structure.png)

In the CNAME file, add the domain you purchased
![CNAME](./images/cname-example.png)

Add, commit, and push those changes up to Github

## Set up Github repo with your new domain

Go to settings in your personal site repo
![Settings](./images/click-settings.png)

Scroll down to Github Pages and select main branch” as the source for your Github pages
![Select Main Branch](./images/select-master.png)

Under “Custom Domain”, enter in your domain where Github pages should serve the Github pages
![Add Domain](./images/enter-domain.png)

## Configure DNS
Log into your domain and navigate the DNS section

For Namecheap,
Login and go to your dashboard
Click “manage” for the domain you need to configure
![Manage](./images/select-manage.png)


Click “Advanced DNS” near the top
![Advanced DNS](./images/select-dns.png)


Under “Host Records”, you’ll be adding 3 new records:

The Github settings are the same for everyone
1. Type: A Record
1. Host: @
1. Value: 192.30.252.153
1. Value: 192.30.252.154

Your CNAME entry:
1. CNAME Record
1. Type: www
1. Value: [your-github-repo-name].github.io

![Enter records](./images/add-records.png)


Voila! You should be deployed!

Whenever you make changes to your personal site, as long as you merge those changes into main, they will be reflected on your domain (sometimes takes a minute, but not that long)
