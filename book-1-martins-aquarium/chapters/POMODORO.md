# The Pomodoro Technique

There's a paradox that many budding software developers experience. The act of programming requires deep thought and complete attention. When you're really focused the world slips away, and all that remains is you, the problem at hand and the code. When things are going well, this feeling of _[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))_ is like no other. It's powerful, intense and just plain awesome. But when things aren't going well - when the problem doesn't quite make sense, when the code just won't work - it's fingernails on the chalkboards of your mind. It's at times like these that the right thing to do is to ask for help.

That's where the paradox comes in. When you're mired in the black depths of bugs, error messages and code that just won't do what is should, you need help. But your brain is so focused on the problem it doesn't have the capacity to consider anything else. Hours pass and suddenly you awake to notice it's dark outside and you need to pee. In short, at times like these you're stuck and should ask for help, but it's that very _stuckness_ distracts you from _realizing_ you should ask for help.

## So, what can we do about it?

One way to overcome this paradox is to think about it in terms of _time management_. It's not really an issue that your concentration is dedicated to the coding problem you're trying to solve. This issue is that because your attention is fully engrossed, you don't realize how much time is passing.

That's where the Pomodoro Technique can help.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/) in the 1980s. In this technique work is done during relatively brief periods of time, and each period is controlled with a timer.

The basic technique is as follows:

1. Divide a larger task into smaller tasks
1. Decide upon a small task to work on
1. Set a timer for **25 minutes**.  
   > **NOTE:** The timer should notify you _(e.g. buzz, beep, slap you in the face, etc...)_ when the 25 minutes has elapsed
1. Work on the task until the timer ends
1. When the timer ends, take a **2 - 5 minute** break
1. After the break, start over with _step 2_

Each _25 minute + 5 minute_ interval is called a _"Pomodoro"_.

## How does Pomodoro Help?

By dividing your time into _working_ and _breaking_ blocks, the Pomodoro Technique helps you direct your attention.

During the 25 minute _working_ phase, _**you are only focused on the task at hand**_. It's perfectly fine to block out the rest of the world. You don't have to think about mowing the yard or washing the dishes. You don't have to think about current events or what's happening on Twitter. You don't have to think about asking for help. You are free to work or to struggle or to stare at your code with the hope that it will magically start working.

When the timer goes off and your _break_ time begins, things change. This _break_ time when you focus on things _**other than** working on the task at hand_. During your _break_ time you should:

1. Get away from your computer, move around a little, get some coffee... In short, _actually take a break_
1. Check email, slack and/or social media
1. Reflect upon the last _working_ period
    * What did you accomplish?
    * Are you being effective? Or, do you need to change your approach?
    * _**Are you stuck? Do you need help?**_
1. Decide upon the next task to work on - _**keeping in mind your next task might be asking for help**_

If, during your reflection, you decide you need help, you should ask for help.

## Pomodoro FAQ

#### What if I finish a task before the _working_ period ends?

You're finished that's great. Stop the timer and take your break right away. Do not pick up a new task within the same working period.

#### How do I know which task to work on?

The Pomodoro Technique doesn't really tell you how to prioritize your work. You're on your own for that. But as you decide you might consider these questions:

* What is my overall goal?
* What tasks are necessary to complete my goal?
* Which tasks are dependent on other tasks?
* How _fresh_ am I feeling? Should I tackle a challenging task or do I need an easier one for the next working period?
* What is the most valuable thing for me to be doing right now?
* Was the last task I was working on the task I really _should_ have been working on?

#### Do I have to finish a task before I move onto another task?

The short answer is "no". You shouldn't change tasks during a working period, but between working periods, you might decide another task has a higher priority for the next working period.

#### 25 Minutes is too long, or too short, for a working period. Can I change it?

The Pomodoro Technique is flexible. You should feel free to adjust the times. However a working period should not be less than 15 minutes nor more than 45 minutes.

However before you decide to change the time intervals you should spend some time sticking with the _25 minute / 5 minute_ approach.

#### Why is it called the "Pomodoro" Technique?

"Pomodoro" is Italian for "tomato". The technique is named after kitchen timer that was shaped like a tomato.
