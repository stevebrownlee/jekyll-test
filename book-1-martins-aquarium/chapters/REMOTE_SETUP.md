# Welcome new NSS students!

## Installing Zoom Remote Classroom

As you know, we are running classes remotely until the experts let everyone know that it's time to reconvene. The tool you will be using is called Zoom. Here is what we need you to do.

1. Visit the [Zoom sign up page](https://zoom.us/signup) and create an account with the **_same email address that you provided to us_**. That's important.
2. Then visit the [Zoom software download page](https://zoom.us/support/download) page, and the software will immediately start downloading to your machine.
3. Once the software has been successfully downloaded, run the installer.
4. That's it! On your first day of class, your senior instructor will share a meeting link with you. When you click on that link, the Zoom software will launch and you can join your classmates and your instructors in the remote classroom.

## Participant Panel and Breakout Rooms

When the meeting starts, you will notice a bar at the bottom of the screen that lets you use Zoom while the meeting is in session.

The first one to remember is the _Participants_ panel. When you click on that, you will see a list of everyone in the meeting. At the bottom of that panel you will see several icons that you can click on to answer yes to a question, say that things are moving too quickly, or virtually raise your hand.

The second one is the breakout rooms. You won't be assigned to breakout rooms on your first day, but just remember that there is an icon on the panel on the bottom to see those. When you have lab time, or working with a team in a group project, you will be assigned to breakout rooms for a quiet space to work.
