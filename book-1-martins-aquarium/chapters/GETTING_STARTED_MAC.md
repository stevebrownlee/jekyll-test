## Security Token for Installations

In order to automate the installation of the tools you need _(which happens in the next section)_, you need to create a Github Personal Access Token.

1. Go to your Github account, and access your settings by clicking on your profile avatar at the top-right of the screen.

1. Then generate a Personal Access Token with a name of **NSS Installs Token**. Make it expire in 7 days. Scroll down into the permissions and check the `admin:public_key` checkbox and click it. Then scroll all the way down and save the token. **It is important you do not close, or refresh the browser tab until you complete the automated installs in the next section.**

## Basic Installations (automated)

1. Open the Terminal application on your Mac.
