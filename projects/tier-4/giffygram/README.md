# Giffygram: Social Animation Platform

Perhaps you've used other social media platforms that allow users to share beautiful pictures with each other. An new opportunity that none of these platforms specialize in Gif animation images. A team of developers went to some angel investors and convinced them that you have a solid business plan and that people around the world have been craving an app for sharing only gifs.

That team of developers began coding, and quickly deployed their [first Minimally Viable Product](http://giffygram.nss.team/) (MVP).

## Deconstruction

Your job is to deconstruct the deployed version of the application. Given your knowledge of modular web application concepts so far, you and your teammates must use your critical thinking, creative thinking, collaboration, and complex communication skills to document the following items.

1. What components make up this application?
2. What state is being tracked in the application?
3. What state is persistent? Reverse engineer the data and their relationships and build an ERD.
4. What state is transient? Is there any state being tracked, but not permanently in the API?
5. What event listeners are used in this application? Which components have event listeners?
6. What fetch calls are used in this application to modify state? What method (GET, POST, DELETE) is used on each?
7. What bugs/incomplete features still need to be fixed or implemented?

Once your team feels that you have adequately deconstructed Giffygram, schedule a review with an instructor and present your findings.
