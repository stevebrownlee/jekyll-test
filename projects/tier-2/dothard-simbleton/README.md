# Dothard &amp; Simbleton

![dothard and simbleton](./chapters/images/dothard-simbleton.jpg)

Since one of your primary jobs as a software developer will be to filter, transform, organize, sort, and then display collections of data, you will need to know how to use some of the helpful methods that software development languages provide to perform those operations.

For this project, you will be helping Doris. Doris owns a paper distribution and services franchise of Dothard & Simbleton. While she operates a paper franchise, she realizes that far too much of her operation is done on paper and she needs to start building software to automate processes and eliminate waste.

To help solve her problems, you will use methods that are automatically available on any array in JavaScript. Array methods will let you perform more advanced operations on collections of data with far less code than a basic `for..of` loop.
