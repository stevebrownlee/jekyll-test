# Algorithmic Thinking Reminder

This project is more complex than either DeShawn's Dog Walking or Brewed Awakenings, and you are not provided with any initial, boilerplate code.

It is crucial, therefore, that you work on designing the algorithm before you write **any** code.

1. What are the main resources (i.e. tables)? Design your ERD first.
1. What are the properties of each resource?
1. What is the relationship between the resources? If it's many-to-many, what additional data must you design in your ERD?
1. Which modules should you create?
1. What is the responsibility of each module?
1. What functions should be in which modules?
1. What is the responsibility of each function?
1. What should each function return?
1. What is the spcific algorithm for each function? Does the function need parameters? Should it return something?

Do all of this before you write a single line of code, or you could end up wasting hours of time writing code only to find that you need to throw it all away because you didn't design the algorithm first.
