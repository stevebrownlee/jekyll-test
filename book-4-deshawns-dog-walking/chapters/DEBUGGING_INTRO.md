As a software developer, the developer tools in the browser are where you will spend about 75% of your time and focus. Being comfortable with the debugger and stepping through your code one line at a time to see what's happening is a crucial, core skill for a junior developer.

By the end of the client side course, you are expected to be proficient in the use of your developer tools.

> "But they are scary, I want to avoid them."

That's not a Growth Mindset. That is your Fixed Mindset talking. Professional software developers have a Growth Mindset and strategically use their time to get better at the skills needed to be successful.
