If you find yourself creeping up on 30 minutes of trying to get the code to work, it's time to go to a peer, or an instructor for assistance.

As always, you can peek at [most of the solution](./code/employeeSales.js).

## Dev Tools Practice

Use the Event Listeners panel to discover, and the Event Listener Breakpoints panel to debug, the events in your code. If you don't know what this means, then you skipped chapter 5 of the guided tour.

Go read that chapter now and watch the accompanying video.
